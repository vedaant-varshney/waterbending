# Waterbending
Addmitedly (partially) ChatGPT'd code to simualte waves in a 3D space with a discrete grid of cubes

## Installation
- OpenGL installed to work
- For C++ may need SDL and other libraries

### Python

(Venv might be diff for )
```
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 test.py

```

# Future Plans
- Use FDM based wave simulation so waves can work based on user input
